## Planning

1. Sketching out what the HTML and CSS would need to look like
2. Once the HTML and CSS was completed, I started psuedo-coding the JavaScript
    - Unfortunately, this was quite the challenge because I couldn't get the questions to cycle through and needed help. 
3. Once most of the questions could cycle through, I needed to revamp some HTML by adding an 'h2' below the 'ol' section to give feedback
4. Once the feedback was working, I could go on to biuld the input name section


## Issues

There are a few issues that I cannot solve as I am struggling to understand JavaScript despite going to TA and Tutor sessions and researching online

1. The timer will stop sometimes and other times it will now
2. I can't figure out how to pull the value of the timer instead of the whole text content
3. The submit button isn't actually working beyond storing the 'storedScores' array
4. I can't figure out how to college the value from the Name Input and text content to push into an array 
5. Because I cannot do the previous issue, I cannot build or present the high scores.
